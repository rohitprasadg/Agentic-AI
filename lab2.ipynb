       "The concept you're referring to is often called \"continuous creation\" or \"continuous becoming,\" where an individual's sense of identity is formed through a process of gradual construction, revision, and reorganization over time. This perspective challenges traditional notions of personal identity as fixed, essential, and timeless.\n",
       "\n",
       "Henry Pretender's case raises interesting questions about the nature of self and continuity. Without any memories before age 16, it's likely that his sense of identity was initially rooted in external sources such as family, culture, and social context rather than internal experiences or memories.\n",
       "\n",
       "As Henry navigates various experiences and creates a narrative about himself, he gradually transforms into a new persona by age 35. This transformation is likely driven by a complex interplay between internal factors (e.g., cognitive biases, emotional needs) and external influences (e.g., social pressures, cultural expectations).\n",
       "\n",
       "From a theoretical perspective, this phenomenon can be understood through various frameworks:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Social Constructionism**: Henry's self-identity is constructed through social interactions, relationships, and cultural norms. As he navigates these experiences, his identity is shaped by the collective meanings attributed to him.\n",
       "2. **Narrative Identity Theory (NIT)**: According to NIT, individuals construct their sense of self through storytelling and shared values. Henry's narrative about himself is constantly evolving as he accumulates experiences and adjusts his personal values and attitudes.\n",
       "3. **Developmental Psychodynamics**: This perspective emphasizes the role of psychological development and growth in shaping identity. As Henry matures and experiences various challenges and successes, his internalized sense of self evolves and adapts to these changes.\n",
       "4. **Embodied Cognition Theory**: Henry's body and senses are deeply embedded in his experiences and interactions with the world. As he navigates new social roles, relationships, and environments, his physical self incorporates aspects of the newly constructed identity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key questions arise from this phenomenon:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Is Henry still the same person before and after his transformation?\n",
       "* Where lies the core, essential Henry Pretender – a combination of past experiences, memories, values, or something else?\n",
       "* Can self-identity be considered as an ongoing process of discovery, revision, and construction?\n",
       "\n",
       "Theories like these acknowledge that identity is not fixed but dynamic and multifaceted. Identity emerges from interactions between internal processes (e.g., thoughts, emotions) and external contexts (e.g., social norms, cultural expectations).\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, the nature of personal identity in individuals like Henry Pretender underscores the complex interplay between self-formation, experiences, and context-shaping factors."
